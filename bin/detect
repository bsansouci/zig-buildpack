# This script serves as the
# [**Zig Buildpack**](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python)
# detector.
#
# A [buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) is an
# adapter between a Zig application and Heroku's runtime.

# ## Usage
# Compiling an app into a slug is simple:
#
#     $ bin/detect <build-dir> <cache-dir>

BUILD_DIR=$1

# Exit early if app is clearly not a zig project.
if [ -f $BUILD_DIR/build.zig ]; then
  echo Zig
else
  exit 1
